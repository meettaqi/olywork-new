"""Backfill the `cost` schema's unit + provenance keys across src/olywork/catalog/*.yaml.

Run from the repo root: `uv run python scripts/catalog_cost_provenance.py [--check] [service ...]`

Why this is a script and not a one-off hand edit: 2,617 endpoints carry a price, 661 of them wrote
"free" three incompatible ways, and the EXTENDED tier is regenerated wholesale by
scripts/catalog_ingest.py — which would drop every provenance key a human typed in. So the mapping
from "what the repo already knows about a provider's pricing" to "the keys `cost_view` and
`platform_eligible` need" lives here, in one table, and is re-runnable after any re-ingest.

It is IDEMPOTENT and additive: it never invents a figure. Every number it writes is either already
in the file (in `cost.value`, or in prose in `cost.note`) or is the arithmetic of two numbers that
are. Where a provider publishes no figure, the entry is marked `confidence: unknown` and left
without one — a guessed price is worse than an honest gap, because a gap refuses a platform key and
a guess spends real money (docs/context/architecture/catalog.md, Cost).

The three confidence levels it assigns, and what earns them:
  verified   — the price came from the provider's OWN live rate card (TikHub's
               get_all_endpoints_info, DataForSEO's /appendix/user_data) or was observed being
               billed on a real call. Re-checkable without trusting a docs page.
  documented — transcribed from the provider's docs or pricing page during the 2026-07-28 sweep.
  inferred   — the recorded figure is a floor or the top of a published range (base-fee-plus-per-row
               endpoints, "1-9 credits", "$0.50-$5.00 per 1,000"), so it is not the whole charge.

Rewriting preserves each block's existing STYLE (a one-line `cost: {…}` stays one line) and every
comment in the file, because the comments in these files are the curation record.
