"""Register olywork's MCP server into the coding agents on this machine — headless, header-authed.

The sibling of `olywork skill bootstrap`. Bootstrap drops a SKILL.md into each agent's skills dir (a
uniform file-drop). MCP is not uniform: each agent keeps its server list in its OWN file and schema,
so this writes each format rather than one shared thing.

**Why a static `Authorization` header and not OAuth here.** olywork IS an OAuth authorization server,
and a browser "connect" flow exists — but the whole point of this command is the *headless* path: an
agent (or install.sh) is handed a team-scoped token and wires every agent up with no browser. A
client only falls back to OAuth discovery when it gets a 401; olywork returns 200 for a valid header, so
the header is honoured and OAuth never triggers (verified against Claude Code, which otherwise prefers
OAuth — the determinant is "does the server 200 a valid header", which olywork does).

**Kept deliberately small and correct over broad.** Only agents whose MCP format is verified are
written: Claude Code via its own `claude mcp add` (it owns its format, and redacts the token in its
output), Cursor and opencode via their documented JSON, Codex as one `[mcp_servers.olywork]` table in
its TOML with an inline `http_headers` map (verified live: the tools load with no env var). CLI-light:
stdlib only — no yaml (server-only dep), which is why Hermes is reported as manual rather than
half-written wrong. There is no TOML writer in stdlib either, so the Codex block is appended as text
after any previous olywork table is cut out, and `tomllib` proves the result parses before it lands.

The Codex entry once said "set OLYWORK_TOKEN in its environment and use `bearer_token_env_var`". A user
followed that, restarted the Codex app, the variable was gone, olywork 401'd and Codex silently dropped
every olywork tool; their agent then drove the dashboard through Codex's browser and burnt their daily
Codex allowance on a $0.13 job. Never hand Codex a token by env-var reference.

DeepSeek Harness is manual for a different reason: it has no MCP config file at all. A server there
is a row in a profile's composition layer, and the answer is to install olywork's own bundle, which
carries that row — see docs/DSH-PLUGIN.md.
