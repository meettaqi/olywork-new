"""The /jev "xboost" demo: launch posts on X from the last 24h -> engagement forensics -> jev verdict.

olywork is a CLIENT here, not the proxy: the pipeline calls olywork's own public `/call/` API with a member
token (`jev_olywork_token`), exactly as a visitor's agent would, so the receipt on the page is a real
bill. jev answers through the Vercel AI Gateway (`ai_gateway_api_key`). The daily run is
`olywork-worker jev xboost`; a visitor can also judge one post by URL (`judge_url`). Both write the
same JSON document under Ephemeral (`jev`, `xboost`) which `/jev/xboost.json` serves.
